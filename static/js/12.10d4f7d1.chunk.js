Stoic, intelligent, and idealistic, yet uncomfortable with her role as leader, she taps into the ancestral magics of her lineage to wield a bow of True Ice. With her people\u2019s belief that she is the mythological hero Avarosa reincarnated, Ashe hopes to unify the Freljord once more by retaking their ancient, tribal lands.<br />Ashe hails from the northern Freljord, where brutal tribal raids and inter-clan warfare are as much a part of the landscape as the scream of the frozen winds, and the unyielding cold of the tundra.<br /><br />The only child of Grena, the matriarchal chieftain of the tiny Avarosan tribe, Ashe was Iceborn: a member of the warrior caste, gifted with an ancestral connection to the magic of her lands, and the rare ability to wield the power of True Ice. Everyone assumed that Ashe would follow her mother as the tribe\'s next leader. However, this was never a glory Ashe desired. The grim responsibility of her warlike lineage and extraordinary gifts instead left Ashe feeling isolated, burdened, and alone.<br /><br />Her only respite was when Sejuani, an Iceborn girl from a sister tribe, would stay with them for the summer hunts around the Ornnkaal Rocks. The girls\' friendship defined their childhoods, but was cut short just as they reached their teens. Somehow, Grena had offended Sejuani\'s grandmother, and the fellowship between their tribes ended suddenly.<br /><br />Soon after, with her youth fading, Ashe\'s mother began her lifelong quest for the \\"Throne of Avarosa\\", a supposed hoard of treasures and magical items that she hoped would return her people to greatness.<br /><br />But Grena\u2019s belief in prophecies and legends led her to take risks, which often left her tribe enfeebled. Finally, during a dangerous and unnecessary raid in another tribe\'s lands, Grena was killed. Her sudden death left young Ashe on the run, while most of her tribe was wiped out.<br /><br />Alone, pursued, Ashe followed her mother\'s last map to a deserted glacier where she found the supposed grave of Avarosa, and her magical bow of True Ice. Ashe used the weapon to avenge her mother\'s death, then turned west.<br /><br />Whether it was out of duty or loneliness, Ashe gained a reputation by protecting the many scattered hearthbound tribes she encountered. She spurned the custom of taking thralls, and instead chose to adopt these desperate people as full members of her new tribe, and her fame grew quickly. Soon many began to believe that she did not just carry the weapon of Avarosa\u2014Ashe was the legend herself, reborn and destined to reunite the Freljord.<br /><br />But tall tales would not feed her followers, and their long march south left the tribe on the verge of starvation. So, Ashe leveraged the myths surrounding her, using them to form alliances with the powerful and land-rich southern tribes, promising to unite them into a nation capable of challenging neighboring kingdoms.<br /><br />These new alliances brought new dangers, and Ashe quickly found herself at the center of a political feud. A Warmother, as Freljordian tribal leaders are known, was expected to wed, and taking a husband from one of the major tribes would anger the others. Ashe could take several husbands, but this would only bring the conflict to a boil within her own household, and the ensuing bloodshed would shatter the alliances she had fought to build.<br /><br />Her answer was an impoverished vagabond from a mountain clan that had been nearly wiped out\u2014the warrior Tryndamere. He was neither a spirit-walker nor blessed with any elemental powers, but upon his arrival in Ashe\u2019s new capital, Tryndamere had thrown himself into every dueling ring he could find. He fought with abandon, desperate to prove the destitute survivors of his clan were worthy of adoption by one of the stronger tribes. But even for the Freljord, his brutal fighting style and extraordinary vitality were unsettling, and many suspected he was touched by dark magic. Ignoring this, Ashe offered to adopt his people as her own, if he became her first and only bloodsworn.<br /><br />Tryndamere accepted reluctantly. Though a political marriage, the attraction they felt for each other was palpable, and slowly a true affection blossomed.<br /><br />Now, Ashe stands at the head of the largest coalition of Freljordian tribes in many generations. Even so, the unity she would bring rests upon an uneasy peace threatened by internal intrigues, foreign powers, the growing violent horde of the Winter\'s Claw, and a supposed destiny that Ashe must at least pretend to believe\u2026","stories":["THE HARDER PATH<br />The colossal brazier flared to life, its flames reaching high into the air. In times past, the gathered tribes would use this as the mark of the festival\u2019s beginning.<br /><br />The harvest festival had always been the largest celebration of the year for the tribes, and one of the last before winter set in on the plains. As the fire was lit, cheers should have echoed up the frozen slopes of the mountains, calling down blessings from the Three Sisters. Now, though, the mass of gathered Avarosans remained silent as they turned away from the flames to look up to the stage where Ashe stood.<br /><br />She let her eyes roam over them. No festival had ever seen so many gathered together, and she knew they had come to see her.<br /><br />She grabbed her bow and unslung it, the now-familiar piercing chill of the True Ice surging through her body. The cold was still painful, even after all her time with the weapon\u2014but now she welcomed it, using it to focus and block out distractions. She lifted her gaze from the crowd to the roaring flame, and took a deep breath as she pulled back the bowstring. All other sounds of the festival faded.<br /><br />A crystal arrow of pure cold formed, beckoned forth by the deep magic coursing through the bow. Ashe held her breath as she let it continue to channel magic through her arms. The temperature on the stage plummeted, frost creeping out from beneath her feet.<br /><br />When the cold threatened to finally overwhelm her, she released her breath and let the arrow fly.<br /><br />It arced high over the crowd, and slammed into its target with a deafening crack. In an instant, the brazier was frozen over, the dancing shapes of the fire enveloped by the spreading ice. The setting sun shone through the crystalized flames and onto the crowd below, and finally the cheer broke out. The crowd invoked the blessings of the Three\u2014Lissandra, Serylda, and Avarosa herself, reincarnated in Ashe.<br /><br />Ashe kept her address short.<br /><br />\\"Avarosans! Never before has a harvest festival seen so many. Sit with your kin from across the snows\u2014we are one family now. Eat, drink, and enjoy!\\"<br /><br />She smiled as the crowd cried out her name. She raised her bow high, and the cheers rose higher in response.<br /><br />Inwardly, she grimaced. As so often, she wondered if it was her leadership that drew them all together, or the weapon she carried. It was the symbol of Avarosa, and many in the Freljord believed that, as its wielder, she was Avarosa reborn. Ashe slung the bow over her shoulder and shook the thought. Why they joined wasn\u2019t as important as what they had become. She hopped off the stage and moved into the crowd as they dispersed to feast-laden tables.<br /><br />The boisterous tribes mixed together, sharing food, drink, and tales of hunts past. The Stonepicks described the warm yet treacherous southern mountains. Ashe cheered with the others when the Red Snows recounted the defeat of the Noxian warbands that had tried to advance inland from the coast. A warrior from the Ice Veins, storied blizzard walkers one and all, clapped Ashe on the back as she passed, sending a strange chill through her.<br /><br />All these and more had responded to her call and joined the festivities. All had pledged themselves to the Avarosans, and each tribe needed her to be something different. A prophet, a savior, a mediator. A Warmother.<br /><br />Ashe would be them all if she could.<br /><br />As she neared the far end of the feast, though, she froze. At the last table, sitting somber and removed from the rest, was a group of Iceborn that she knew all too well\u2014the Snow Followers, vengeful zealots who had slaughtered a whole tribe only months ago.<br /><br />A tribe whose only crime had been joining the Avarosans.<br /><br />A large woman, doubtless their leader, rose and approached Ashe. \\"Warmother Ashe, Avarosa\u2019s chosen, wielder of Her divine bow. My name is Hildhur Svarhem, truthbearer and Warmother of the Snow Followers.\\"<br /><br />Ashe imagined the sight of the scorched huts again, the screams of her people dying in agony, and her fury ignited. The crowd around them quieted as Hildhur continued, whispers spreading quickly. All gathered had heard of what the Snow Followers had done.<br /><br />\\"We swore an oath that no faith-traitors would ever again follow those falsely claiming to be Avarosa reborn. Your warriors fought bravely, but not well.\\" She unslung a large war-axe from her back, its blade coated in a thin but clear layer of True Ice. A true Iceborn, she bore the discomfort of the weapon\u2019s chilling effect silently.<br /><br />Ashe measured the woman\u2019s wide stance, counted the few steps between them. Dried blood matted Hildhur\u2019s armor\u2014more Avarosan blood? Ashe\u2019s muscles tensed as she prepared to move. She was ready for any attack.<br /><br />What she was not ready for, however, was for the Warmother to kneel, lower her head, and offer up the war-axe with both hands.<br /><br />\\"Forgive us, Warmother Ashe. I did not know then what I do now. I came to challenge you before all your followers, to unmask you as a false prophet. But the magic you wield is beyond any I have ever witnessed. None can deny that She speaks through you. I offer you my axe, Joutbane, and my head. Spare my people, that they may prove their worth by hunting, farming, and dying in your name.\\"<br /><br />Each of the gathered Snow Followers followed their Warmother\u2019s example, kneeling in deference.<br /><br />At once, voices from the crowd called for vengeance. \\"Death to the raiders!\\" they cried.<br /><br />Barely more than smoldering ruins when Ashe had arrived, the skeletal remains told the story of a village surrounded. The few warriors had been easily identified, for their bodies were untouched by fire, but hacked down and left for the crows. The rest of the tribe had hidden in their homes, praying for mercy, or simply a quick death.<br /><br />They received neither\u2026<br /><br />Eyes welled up with fury, Ashe reached for the axe. She would take Hildhur\u2019s head, as a warning to any who would\u2014<br /><br />As her hand clasped around it, and the True Ice sent the familiar spike of cold through her arm, Ashe felt her bow beginning to radiate against her back. A slow, chilling pulse, like a winter breeze.<br /><br />Her mind calmed.<br /><br />\\"Stand, Hildhur,\\" she said, looking down at the war-axe.<br /><br />Hildhur rose, furrowing her brow in confusion. Ashe met her probing gaze.<br /><br />\\"The Snow Followers have shed the blood of my tribe, and they are my enemies,\\" she continued. \\"But you have shown humility and remorse, here and now. You are not the Snow Followers any longer\u2014from today forward, you are Avarosan, and that makes you family. You have nothing to fear from me, cousin.\\"<br /><br />She thrust the war-axe back into the woman\u2019s hands, and the tension in the air broke. Soon enough, the celebrations were underway again, the joyous feelings redoubled by forgiveness and mercy. Ashe walked to everyone seated at the table, welcoming each in turn.<br /><br />As she turned from them and walked away, she was careful to keep her grief in check. Her heart still burned, but her people needed her to walk a different path than that of revenge. She played her fingers along the bowstring, seeking comfort in its chill.<br /><br />She would be better. She must."]},"table":{"name":"Ashe","image":"ashe.png","general":{"Title":"The Frost Archer","Pronouns":"She/Her","Release date":"February 21st, 2009","Cost":"450 260","Primary":"Marksman","Secondary":"Support"},"statistics":{"HP":"570 (+87)","HPR":"3.5 (+0.55)","MP":"280 (+32)","MPR":"6.972 (+0.4)","MS":"325","AD":"59 (+2.96)","AS":"0.658 (+3.33%)","RNG":"600","AR":"26 (+3.4)","MR":"30 (+0.5)"}},"abilities":[{"key":"Passive","name":"Frost Shot","img":"frost_shot.png","description":"<span class=\'passiveActive\'>Frost Shot:</span> Spells and basic attacks slow targets for 2 seconds, and basic attacks against targets with Frost Shot deal bonus damage equal to <span class=\'adConversion\'>10%</span> <span class=\'critConversion\'>+ [Critical Chance \xd7 (1 + Bonus Critical Damage)]%</span> <span class=\'adConversion\'>AD</span>.<br/><span class=\'passiveActive\'>Critical Slow:</span> Ashe\'s critical strikes deal no extra damage, but they double Frost Shot\'s slow, decaying to the base amount over the 1 second.","stats":[],"lvl-upgrades":["<span class=\'importantText\'>Slow:</span> <abbr title=\'20 + 2% per 3 levels until 16\'>20 - 30% (based on level)</abbr>"]},{"key":"Q","name":"Ranger\'s Focus","img":"rangers_focus.png","description":"<span class=\'passiveActive\'>Passive:</span> Basic attacks grant Focus for 4 seconds, stacking up to 4 times.
