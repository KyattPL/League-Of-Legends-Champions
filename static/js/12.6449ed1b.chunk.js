Though fueled by a poison that renders him mute, he is guided by his sister Alune in her distant temple sanctuary from where she pushes an arsenal of moonstone weapons into his hands. For as long as the moon shines overhead, Aphelios will never be alone.<br />The moon looms over the towering slopes of Mount Targon, distant, yet impossibly close.<br /><br />Born during a rare lunar convergence, when the physical moon was eclipsed by its reflection in the spirit realm, Aphelios and his twin sister, Alune, were celebrated as children of destiny by those of Targon\u2019s Lunari faith.<br /><br />Mirroring the celestial event that heralded their birth, the two children knew they had been marked by fate\u2014Aphelios physically gifted like the moon of stone, and Alune magically like its spiritual reflection. Zealously devout, they grew up within a faith of mystery, reflection, and discovery, and embraced darkness not just out of belief, but as the only thing that could keep them safe.<br /><br />The Solari who ruled Targon considered the Lunari heretics, driving them into hiding until most forgot the Lunari even existed. The Lunari were left to the shadows, dwelling in temples and caves far from the Solaris\u2019 sight.<br /><br />The pressure to be exemplary weighed heavily upon Aphelios. He practiced tirelessly with mystical moonstone blades, spilling his own blood in training so he could spill that of others to protect the faith. Intense and vulnerable, he bonded deeply with his sister in lieu of any other friendships.<br /><br />While Aphelios was sent on increasingly dangerous missions to protect the Lunari, Alune trained separately as a seer, using her luminous magic to reveal hidden pathways and truths by the moon\u2019s light. In time, her tasks required her to leave the temple where they were raised.<br /><br />Without Alune, Aphelios\u2019 faith wavered.<br /><br />Desperate for purpose, he undertook a ceremonial journey into darkness where Lunari were said to discover their paths\u2014their orbits. He followed the moon\u2019s light to a pool where rare noctum flowers bloomed beneath the water\u2019s surface. Though poisonous, the flowers could be distilled into a liquid that opened him to the night\u2019s power.<br /><br />Drinking the noctum\u2019s essence, Aphelios felt so much pain that it numbed him to everything else.<br /><br />Soon after, an ancient temple, the Marus Omegnum, began to come into phase from the spirit realm for the first time in centuries. Lunari from across the mountain gathered, emerging from hiding to witness the balance of power shift as celestial cycles in the heavens turned.<br /><br />The fortress accepted only one occupant, gifted in magic, each time it appeared. This time it would be Alune, her orbit guiding her to the temple. Aphelios, usually asking for nothing, requested to attend the event.<br /><br />But as the fortress passed through the veil in a luminous display of magic, a harsher radiance filled the night. Somehow, the Lunari had been discovered even as the celestial cycles turned in their favor.<br /><br />An army of Solari descended upon them.<br /><br />All seemed lost, the Solari purging the Lunari heresy with fire and steel. Even Aphelios was beaten, his moonstone blades shattered on the ground, blood spilling from his lips as he reached for the noctum\u2026<br /><br />But as the battle raged, Alune traveled deeper into the temple\u2014and when she reached its heart, her full potential unlocked. Through the noctum, Aphelios could feel Alune\u2019s power embrace him\u2026 and he could hear her voice. With a whisper, she pushed magic into his hands\u2014a replacement for his blades solidifying into moonstone.<br /><br />Like the moon of stone and its spiritual reflection, Aphelios\u2019s skill and Alune\u2019s magic converged.<br /><br />Those Solari would not live to see the sun again.<br /><br />As her power flared, Alune pushed the temple, and herself within, back into the spirit realm where it would remain safe from the Solari. From inside, amplified by the temple\u2019s focusing power, Alune was able to project her magic anywhere, so long as it found a focus\u2014like the poison coursing through Aphelios\u2019 veins.<br /><br />Only now did they understand their destiny. Aphelios would hollow himself out with pain, but would become a conduit for the moon\u2019s power. Alune would live alone, isolated in her fortress, but she would guide her brother, able to see through his eyes.<br /><br />Together, they would be the weapon the Lunari needed, bound by pain and sacrifice. Only apart could they be together\u2014their souls brushing across the veil, distant, yet impossibly close, converging into something they could not understand.<br /><br />To protect the survivors of the attack who retreated back into the shadows of the mountain, Aphelios\u2019 training as an assassin has been given reach by Alune\u2019s magic\u2014his blades now an arsenal of mystical weapons, perfected by Alune over the course of many missions together.<br /><br />Now that the power balance of Targon is shifting, and the Solari know the Lunari still endure, Aphelios and Alune are needed more than ever.","stories":["YOU ARE THE WEAPON<br />He started his training with a single breath. In, and out.<br /><br />He could hear water dripping through a crack in the cave ceiling, dampening the stone floor until it gleamed against the darkness. He knew the holy patterns carved into the floor\u2019s stone\u2014proclaiming destinies and orbits. Even when he closed his eyes, he could see each lunar arc.<br /><br />He made a few tentative swings with his blade. The moonstone felt solid in his hand, but remained ethereal, as if it wasn\u2019t there. It was a magical remnant of the first convergence when the moon and its reflection in the spirit realm briefly touched across the celestial veil, and moonstone cast off by the union rained down on the world like tears.<br /><br />Following their orbits, the two moons were forced to part.<br /><br />Embracing his own orbit, Aphelios continued to train.<br /><br />His blade was now his breath, drawing faster and faster. His slashes followed arcs he had practiced for years until even he bled, training to the verge of self-destruction. Following his weapon, he twisted through the air. He slashed, parried\u2014each attack flowing into the next. He closed his eyes so he would not need to see\u2026 would not remember everything he\u2019d sacrificed to wield his weapon.<br /><br />\\"Aphelios\u2026\\" You see my face. My lip quivers, though my voice is firm.<br /><br />\\"Aphelios.\\" Reflected in my eyes, you see\u2026<br /><br />Aphelios stumbled as his moonstone blade flashed red and an image of an outlander passed before him. A vision? A memory? How many times had he killed to not know for sure? The blade slipped from his hand, and Aphelios soon followed\u2014colliding against the floor with no weapon to lead him, losing grasp of his discipline.<br /><br />It had all come back. Everything he pushed down. Every cut of his blade into his enemies cut even deeper into himself.<br /><br />Alune\u2026 his sister. She\u2019d reached across the veil. She\u2019d shown him\u2026 but she\u2019d been torn away.<br /><br />Aphelios pushed troubled words he would never say back into his throat. His fingers tightened into a fist, only for a moment, ready to strike against the orbits and destinies carved into stone. But, hand shaking\u2026 he let go.<br /><br />As Aphelios stood and swept back his hair, he noticed the moon had risen, its light shining onto a shrine he kept deeper in the temple. Calling to him, as it did whenever he was needed.<br /><br />It was time. His faith would be rewarded.<br /><br />The Lunari\u2019s power was growing, phasing across the celestial veil. A magic of spirit, of the secrets within\u2014for all of his training, Aphelios could not channel the moon\u2019s power himself. But he would not need to.<br /><br />He carefully prepared noctum flowers that he\u2019d cultivated in the shrine\u2019s pool, pressing their essence into a caustic elixir\u2014the liquid glowing faintly within the mortar bowl.<br /><br />He set aside his training blade and raised the bowl to the moon\u2019s light.<br /><br />Then, without hesitation, he pressed the flower\u2019s poison to his lips.<br /><br />The agony is indescribable. The pain wraps around your throat. You cannot say anything at all\u2026<br /><br />Everything burns. You convulse in misery, you retch and cough as the poison flows through you, opening you to the moon\u2019s power\u2026<br /><br />To me.<br /><br />\\"Aphelios,\\" I whisper from my fortress, and my spirit brushes against yours. You sense my presence across the veil. You raise your hand, knowing that I am too far. That it is the pain you must hold on to.<br /><br />You close your hand around it. It becomes your weapon.<br /><br />I send it to you\u2026<br /><br />Gravitum.<br /><br />\\"Aphelios,\\" I whisper as I feel you cling to the poison that burns you away. Knowing why you make this choice. What I ask you to sacrifice\u2026<br /><br />With a final lung-wracking gasp, Aphelios emerged from the cave temple into the night. His expression hardened as he fought back the wrenching agony, embracing it and leaving everything else behind him.<br /><br />Mount Targon loomed above and below the temple, stretching in both directions.<br /><br />The howling wind whipped up frozen wisps that shimmered as they faded, dancing with Aphelios\u2019 scarf and buffeting his cloak. The light of the moon shone higher still. It would guide him.<br /><br />It was her light, shining through the moon\u2019s.<br /><br />She\u2019d given him what he needed.<br /><br />Gravitum was more than a moonstone blade. In training, he had slashed, stabbed, twirled. To use this weapon, he would do the same\u2014but his reach would be much greater. A simple thrust would unleash its power, his skill and her magic converging.<br /><br />Firing the cannon\u2019s black orbs toward a floating rock that was suspended by the Targon\u2019s heavenly magic, Gravitum\u2019s power slowly drew the island down. With a single leap, Aphelios began running atop the island, his boots casting small drifts of snow into the abyss. Each orb he fired drew another rock close, the floating monoliths colliding behind him as he leapt from one to the next, swiftly scaling a mountain that would take most people days to climb\u2026 if they attempted the climb at all.<br /><br />Only the Solari, and those who sought power, held vigil here.<br /><br />He passed their settlements below, each quiet and ignorant of the night. For years, he had wondered how Solari zealots could deny his faith\u2019s existence, walking their paths to follow the sun, fearing darkness that only Lunari dared face. But his destiny was clear.<br /><br />The zealots would be revealed by the moon\u2019s light.<br /><br />Aphelios leapt to a final island of stone and paused above a snowy clearing where a party of Solari had gathered, their weapons blazing. Burning Ones, the Lunari called them. By night, they scorched out heretics of the moon. By day, their priests denied there was anything but the sun. Beneath dark hoods, their faces were hidden by flame as impersonal as their judgment. They had surrounded a barbarian cloaked in crimson and steel.<br /><br />The outlander he\u2019d seen in his vision.<br /><br />The moon\u2019s light stopped in this clearing. It stopped at the barbarian\u2019s feet.<br /><br />\\"Aphelios,\\" I say again. I whisper it to your soul and gather my magic, knowing the only words you want to hear.<br /><br />\\"I am with you\u2026\\"<br /><br />Aphelios dived off the rock island and plummeted into battle, the Burning Ones\u2019 weapons blazing all the brighter as Gravitum\u2019s darkness spread among them. Crying out in alarm, the Solari turned to fight, but found themselves bound to the ground by a black orb. Aphelios dropped the cannon, and a new weapon appeared in his hand.<br /><br />\\"Severum,\\" I whisper.<br /><br />Landing from his descent without looking away from his enemies\u2019 burning faces, Aphelios slashed behind him with Severum, the crescent pistol\u2019s beam tearing through the island of stone. Terrified, the Burning Ones could only watch as massive slabs slammed down among them, cut loose by the energy of the waning moon.<br /><br />The survivors quickly spread across the clearing, lashing at Aphelios with their molten spears. Weaving between the blows, Aphelios continued to slash with Severum and reached out with his free hand to grasp one more weapon as it passed through the veil, knowing it would be there.<br /><br />\\"Crescendum,\\" I say to the night.<br /><br />With a soaring arc, Crescendum cut through the throats of the remaining Solari in the clearing\u2014Aphelios catching the moonstone blade as it twisted around and returned to his hand.<br /><br />In seconds, it was over.<br /><br />The barbarian stands before you. He looks up, gratefully. Beside him, what the Burning Ones sought: a scimitar curved like the moon.<br /><br />He opens his mouth to thank you, but he sees your expression twist, though you try to hide it. You fight the fear, punching your shoulder where the Burning Ones\u2019 spears cut through your cloak. Trying to remember the pain. Reaching for it.<br /><br />You don\u2019t want to kill him. But you must.<br /><br />Your face is too numb for you to feel the tears\u2026 Instead, you feel mine.<br /><br />\\"Aphelios,\\" I say one last time, forcing my voice through the veil. There is a dizzying rush as our orbits bring us together.<br /><br />Through your eyes, I see what moonlight reveals around the scimitar. Why it was abandoned.<br /><br /><br />She is running\u2026<br /><br />We must find her.<br /><br />The crimson-clad barbarian lay in the snow among the Solari.<br /><br />With a gasp, Aphelios fell to his knees.<br /><br />He glanced up at the moon, listening for a whisper only he could hear.<br /><br />His expression dulled again. Without a word, he picked up the scimitar and walked into the night."]},"table":{"name":"Aphelios","image":"aphelios.png","general":{"Title":"The Weapon of the Faithful","Pronouns":"He/Him","Release date":"December 11th, 2019","Cost":"6300 975","Attribute":"Marksman"},"statistics":{"HP":"530 (+88)","HPR":"3.25 (+0.55)","MP":"348 (+42)","MPR":"6.5 (+0.4)","MS":"325","AD":"57 (+2.4)","AS":"0.64 (+2.1%)","RNG":"550","AR":"28 (+3)","MR":"26 (+0.5)"}},"abilities":[{"key":"Passive","name":"The Hitman and the Seer","img":"the_hitman_and_the_seer.png","description":"<span class=\'passiveActive\'>Passive:</span> Aphelios has five Moonstone Weapons, and can equip two of them in anytime, one as his main weapon and one as his off-hand.
