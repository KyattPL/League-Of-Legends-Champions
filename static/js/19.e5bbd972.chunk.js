Every mead hall north of Frostheld toasts his legendary strength and tells tales of how he felled a forest of oaks in a single night, and punched an entire mountain into rubble. With his shield, an enchanted vault door forged in ages past, Braum roams the frozen north as a cheerful protector, helping the vulnerable as he works toward his dream of a peaceful Freljord.<br />Even as a child, Braum was much larger than other Freljordian youngsters, but his mother taught him never to use his size to intimidate or bully. She came from a proud line of herders, and believed true courage lay in using one\u2019s power not to dominate, but to protect those in need.<br /><br />When Braum was still a boy, ice giants devastated a neighboring tribe. That tribe had long preyed upon the herds of Braum\u2019s people, but his mother didn\u2019t hesitate to head out across the tundra to help the survivors, bearing furs, foodstuffs, and healing supplies. At first, Braum didn\u2019t understand why she would aid their rivals\u2014but after her actions saved many lives, they became lifelong allies. He finally understood what his mother meant when she said all the Freljord\u2019s people were a family, and from that day forth, he pledged to bring that family together.<br /><br />As Braum grew, it was clear he was one of the revered Iceborn, though even among their number, his strength and ability to endure the elements were legendary. He became a local hero, rescuing children who had slipped into icy ravines, saving travelers stranded in blizzards, and protecting families from ravaging wildclaws. Whenever he appeared, people knew help had arrived. He was a figure of hope, known for his liveliness and laughter, and the easy way he made friends.<br /><br />Eventually, Braum realized he was needed beyond the valleys and tundra where he\u2019d been raised. Bidding his mother a tearful farewell, he set out to travel the Freljord.<br /><br />Over the years, countless stories spread of Braum\u2019s mighty feats and good deeds. While most had at least a kernel of truth, they grew increasingly far-fetched and mythic\u2014such as the legend of how he chopped down an entire forest in a single night using only his bare hands, or how during a volcanic eruption, he saved an isolated farmstead by picking it up and carrying it to higher ground.<br /><br />A more recent tale spoke of how Braum found his immense ram-headed shield. As the story went, it was an enchanted vault door, forged in ancient times and set into a mountain. Braum heard cries from within, but he couldn\u2019t break the door down. Undeterred, he punched his way through the mountain\u2019s bare rock, rescuing a troll boy who was trapped inside. He ripped the unbreakable door off its hinges, and has borne it ever since.<br /><br />As with many legends about him, Braum laughed uproariously when he first heard this particular tale\u2014but far from refuting such stories, he embraces them. Why let the truth get in the way of inspiring others to acts of generosity and kindness?<br /><br />No matter how he actually found his shield, soon afterward Braum made his way to the sacred site of Rakelstake, where many tribes had gathered to hear the words of the Avarosan warmother, Ashe\u2014said to be the reincarnation of Avarosa herself. There, he witnessed the barbarian Tryndamere, desperate to prove his worth, savagely beating any who would face him.<br /><br />As Braum watched, he saw that Tryndamere was growing increasingly unhinged. During one duel, he was so lost in his fury that it seemed certain he would kill his opponent, despite having already prevailed. Deciding things had gone far enough, Braum planted himself in front of the downed fighter, shield raised, and Tryndamere hacked and smashed against the impenetrable bulwark. When the barbarian\u2019s rage finally subsided, Braum\u2019s good humor won him over, and before long the pair were laughing and drinking to each other\u2019s health. Some even say that it was Braum who first introduced Tryndamere to Ashe. The barbarian would later marry her, becoming her only bloodsworn.<br /><br />Braum doesn\u2019t hold any particular tribal allegiance, for he views all within the Freljord as brothers and sisters. Even so, he sees in Ashe someone who can end the centuries-old feuding among the Freljord\u2019s tribes, and the Avarosans have informally adopted him into their number. Braum\u2019s dream, as he often tells adoring children, is that someday the Freljord will be united in one big family\u2026 and then he can retire to become a humble poro herder.<br /><br />Though Braum counts no one as his enemy, he has had a few run-ins with the Frostguard since he started carrying his shield. He doesn\u2019t understand why they have a grudge against him, nor why they seem so interested in what he now bears\u2026","stories":["TOMB OF THE TROLL BOY<br />\\"Would you like to hear a bedtime story?\\"<br /><br />\\"Grandma, I\'m too old for that.\\"<br /><br />\\"You\'re never too old to enjoy a good story.\\"<br /><br />The girl reluctantly crawled into bed and waited, knowing she wouldn\u2019t win this battle. A bitter wind howled outside, whipping the falling snow into devil whirls.<br /><br />\\"What kind though? A tale of the <br />Ice Witch, perhaps?\\" asked her grandmother.<br /><br />\\"No, not her.\\"<br /><br />\\"What about a story of <br />Braum?\\"<br /><br />The girl nodded and the old woman smiled.<br /><br />\\"Ah, there are so many, which to choose\u2026? My grandmother used to tell me of the time Braum protected our village from a great dragon! Or once, this was long ago, mind, he raced down a river of lava! Or-\\"<br /><br />She paused and shook her head. \\"No, none of them. Wait, have I ever told you how Braum got his shield?\\"<br /><br />The girl shook her head. The hearth fire snapped, its warmth holding off the night\u2019s chill.<br /><br />\\"Well, in the mountains above our village lived a man named Braum. He mostly kept to his farm, tending his sheep and goats, but he was the kindest man anyone had ever met, and he always had a smile on his face and a laugh on his lips.\\"<br /><br />\\"Now, one day, something terrible happened. A young troll boy around your age was climbing the mountain and happened upon a massive stone door with a shard of True Ice at its center. When he opened the door, he couldn\'t believe his eyes! Beyond was a vault filled with gold and jewels. Every kind of treasure you could imagine!\\"<br /><br />\\"What he didn\'t know was that the vault was a trap. The Ice Witch had cursed it, and as the troll boy entered, the magical door clanged shut behind him! It locked him inside! Try as he might, he couldn\'t escape.\\"<br /><br />\\"A passing shepherd heard the boy\u2019s cries. The entire village rushed to help, but even the strongest warriors couldn\'t open the door. The boy\'s parents were beside themselves. His mother\'s wails of grief echoed around the mountain. It seemed hopeless.\\"<br /><br />\\"And then they heard a distant laugh.\\"<br /><br />\\"It was Braum, wasn\'t it?\\" asked the girl.<br /><br />\\"Aren\'t you clever? Braum had heard their cries and came striding down the mountain. The villagers told him of the troll boy and the curse. Braum smiled and nodded. He turned to the vault and faced the door. He pushed it. Pulled it. Punched it. Kicked it. Even tried to rip it from its hinges, but the door wasn\u2019t for budging.\\"<br /><br />\\"But he\'s the strongest man ever!\\" cried the girl.<br /><br />\\"It was perplexing\\" agreed her grandmother. \\"For many days and nights, Braum sat on a boulder, trying to think of a solution. After all, a child\'s life was at stake.\\"<br /><br />\\"Then, as the sun rose on the fifth day, his eyes widened, and a broad grin lit up his face. \u2018If I can\'t go through the door\' he said \u2018then I\'ll just have to go through-\u2019...\\"<br /><br />The girl thought for a moment. Her eyes went wide as she exclaimed \\"The mountain!\\"<br /><br />\\"The mountain indeed. Braum headed to the summit and began punching his way straight down, pummeling his way through the stone, fist after fist. Rocks flew in his wake, until he had vanished deep into the mountain.\\"<br /><br />\\"As the villagers held their breath, the rock around the door crumbled. And when the dust cleared, they saw Braum standing amidst the treasure, the weak but happy troll boy cradled in his arms.\\"<br /><br />\\"I knew he could do it!\\"<br /><br />\\"But before they could celebrate, everything began to rumble and shake. Braum\'s tunnel had weakened the mountain, and now it was caving in! Thinking quickly, Braum grabbed the enchanted door and held it above him like a shield, protecting the villagers as the mountain collapsed around them. When it was over, Braum was amazed. There wasn\'t a single scratch on the door! Braum knew it was something very special. And from that moment on, the magical shield never left Braum\'s side.\\"<br /><br />The girl sat upright, struggling to conceal her excitement.<br /><br />\\"Grandma\\" she said \\"can you tell me another story?\\"<br /><br />The girl\u2019s grandmother smiled, kissed her forehead and blew out the candle.<br /><br />\\"Tomorrow\\" she said. \\"You need to sleep, and there are many more stories to tell.\\""]},"table":{"name":"Braum","image":"braum.png","general":{"Title":"The Heart of the Freljord","Pronouns":"He/Him","Release date":"May 11th, 2014","Cost":"4800 880","Primary":"Support","Secondary":"Tank"},"statistics":{"HP":"540 (+98)","HPR":"8.5 (+1)","MP":"310.6 (+45)","MPR":"6 (+0.8)","MS":"335","AD":"55.376 (+3.2)","AS":"0.644 (+3.5%)","RNG":"125","AR":"47 (+4)","MR":"32.1 (+1.25)"}},"abilities":[{"key":"Passive","name":"Concussive Blows","img":"concussive_blows.png","description":"<span class=\'passiveActive\'>Innate:</span> Braum\'s basic attacks apply <span class=\'stack\'>Concussive Blows</span> for 4 seconds.
