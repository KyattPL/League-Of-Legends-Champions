He often retrieves and returns the tithes cast into the sea by superstitious captains, but even the saltiest of sailors know better than to cross him\u2014for many are the tales of those who have underestimated this slippery character. Often mistaken for some manner of capricious ocean spirit, he seems able to command the beasts of the deep, and delights in confounding his allies and enemies alike.<br />In ages past, the oceans of Runeterra were home to civilizations far older than those of the land. In the depths of what is now the Guardian\u2019s Sea, a great city once stood\u2014it was here that the yordle Fizz made his home. He lived alongside the artisans and warriors of that proud, noble race. Even though he was not one of them, they treated him as an equal, and his playful nature and tall tales of adventures in the open sea made him welcome at any gathering.<br /><br />But the world was changing. The oceans were growing warmer, emboldening fierce predators to rise up from the deepest trenches. Other settlements had fallen silent, but the rulers of the great city could still not agree on how to deal with the threat. Fizz pledged to roam the seas in search of survivors, or anyone who knew what had happened.<br /><br />Then, one dark day, the gigalodons came.<br /><br />These huge dragon-sharks stunned their prey with fell shrieking, and the avenues of the great city were soon clouded red. Thousands died in a matter of hours, the immense bulk of their killers crushing towers and temples in a monstrous feeding frenzy. Scenting blood in the water, Fizz raced back, determined to join the fight and save the city.<br /><br />He was too late. There was nothing left of the city to save. When the debris finally settled, not a single living creature remained, nor any stone upon another, and the ravenous shoal had moved on. Alone in the cold depths, Fizz sank into mournful despair. As his yordle magic began to fade, he let himself be carried by the currents, drifting in a catatonic torpor, dreaming away the millennia\u2026<br /><br />It was only chance that reawakened him. A handful of copper coins fell from above, scattered to the seabed in the wake of a huge, wooden fish that swam upon the surface. This was no gigalodon, but Fizz was alarmed nonetheless\u2014he knew little of the world overhead, but surely no fish could survive up there? He ventured up and peered into the salty air for the first time.<br /><br />There were people, people who lived outside of the water and sailed in wooden fish of all sizes. Fizz found the thought both frightening and exciting, but the curious gifts they cast into the water made it clear that they wanted to be his friends. In time, following their movements to and fro across the oceans, he came to the port city of Bilgewater.<br /><br />To the inhabitants of that lawless place, this strange and slippery creature quickly became something of a legend\u2014the Tidal Trickster, a spirit of the ocean itself. It is said that he can summon great beasts to do his bidding, hole a ship\u2019s hull with his stone trident, and breathe air or water as it suits him. Many a misbehaving child has been warned on a moonless night: \\"Go quickly to sleep, or the Trickster will come and feed you to the fishes\u2026\\"<br /><br />Fizz is good-natured, but mischievous even for a yordle, and delights in confounding the people of Bilgewater. The most seasoned fishermen know, just as the ocean may rise and fall, the Tidal Trickster is as likely to lead them into windless doldrums as to an easy catch that would fill their nets. Even so, Fizz does not take kindly to the greedy or selfish, and more than one haughty sea captain hoping to make a quick pile of silver has found that her mysterious guide has led her crew not to safety, but to shipwreck.","stories":["THE LUCKY KRAKEN<br />Eh! Well, \u2018allo there, young \u2018uns. Shouldn\u2019t you cheeky little sprats already be a-bed? What\u2019s that? You want a suppertime story from old One-Legged Lars, eh?<br /><br />Alright, alright, just one \u2018afore bed. Gather round. But I don\u2019t wanna hear no cryin\u2019 or whimperin\u2019 this time. This is Bilgewater, after all, and even our bedtime tales have more\u2019n a little darkness in \u2018em.<br /><br />Right. Now, you\u2019ve heard of the Tidal Trickster, the little ocean sprite they call Fizz, ain\u2019t ya? Ye have? Good, good. Well, this is a story about the time old Lars met him. What\u2019s that? Must have been fun? Well, what sort o\u2019 stories you been told? No it weren\u2019t fun, thank you very much! He\u2019s a malign little terror, that one, and you\u2019ll be lucky if you never cross paths with \u2018im in all your lives. But I\u2019m gettin\u2019 ahead of me self. Ahem.<br /><br />Right, so there I was, clingin\u2019 to a rock out in the Jagged Straits. Me ship was sunk don\u2019t matter how it happened, there\u2019s a tale for another night, maybe but that\u2019s as it was. I clung to that rock for three days and nights, with fins a-circlin\u2019.<br /><br />And just when I was startin\u2019 to give up all hope... he appeared.<br /><br />All I seen at first were those two big, round eyes, pale as death, as he swam towards me. Them circling sharks took off right away, and no mistake they was a-feared of him, see, just as you all should be. Closer, and closer, and closer \u2018e came. I don\u2019t mind admittin\u2019 I were scared, but he\u2019d shooed off them hungry fishes, so I dove into the sea, and started swimmin\u2019 for Bilgewater, as quick as ye like!<br /><br />But every time I looks back, \u2018e was there, with those big eyes peerin\u2019 at me! I finally get to shore, and thought I\u2019d lost \u2018im... But how wrong old Lars was!<br /><br />I got a room in a flea-ridden flophouse down Rat Town way, but it didn\u2019t take long for me to realize... I weren\u2019t alone. What first clued me was the creepin\u2019 stink o\u2019 seaweed and fish in me room. Oh, pooh! That and the little wet footprints on the stair when I awoke in the mornin\u2019...<br /><br />They call \u2018im the Trickster, and he certainly lived up to the name. Put seawater in me porridge when I weren\u2019t lookin\u2019! Tied me bootlaces together, so I fell as soon as took a step! And slipped eels under me blankets! Give me a right proper scare when they started wrigglin\u2019, I\u2019ll tell ye!<br /><br />And all the time, I hears \u2018im laughing. Still makes me skin crawl, just to think of it. For a whole week Fizz haunted me. Drove me fairly to the brink o\u2019 madness! \\"What do ye want, you little monster?\\" I screams!<br /><br />But on the final night, I woke. I heared his webbed feet, flappin\u2019 on the floor. Slap. Slap. Slap.<br /><br />Closer, \u2018e came, and closer. \\"This is it!\\" I thought. \\"He\u2019s come to end me, once and for all,\\" and I hid me self under the covers.<br /><br />Slap. Slap. Slap, went his cold, wet feet! And then... silence. I lay there, cowering, for what must\u2019ve been an hour, \u2018afore I dared a peek. Slowly, I reaches out, lights the lamp, and do you know what happened next?<br /><br />Nothin\u2019.<br /><br />Aye, Fizz were gone, at long last. But he left something for me, on the wooden box \u2018aside me bed. A coin, a gold Kraken, no less. This coin here, in fact! Eh, eh, look wi\u2019 your eyes, not your \u2018ands! That\u2019s my lucky Kraken, ye know.<br /><br />But I tell you, rather than make me happy for I hadn\u2019t a penny to me name back then the sight of that coin filled me with dread. \u2018Cos this were the very coin that our captain swore he tossed into the ocean, on our way out o\u2019 port. That was his offering to the Bearded Lady for safe passage, but the Tidal Trickster had took it! That was the reason our ship\u2019d sunk! That playful, hateful little imp, he\u2019d doomed the whole crew, and done it with a wicked, fishy grin on his face.<br /><br />So, I tell you little sprats now, pray you never encounter \u2018im, \u2018cos while \u2018e might seem all fun and games, let me tell you now \u2013 he ain\u2019t.<br /><br />Now, off to bed with ye! And pray you don\u2019t see no little wet footprints on the floorboards when you wake!
