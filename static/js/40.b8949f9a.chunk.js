Hailing from parts unknown, he now searches for rare ingredients among the unblemished wastes of the Freljord, trying each recipe as he goes. Often intoxicated and extremely impulsive, he is legendary for the brawls he starts, which often end in all-night parties and widespread property damage. Any appearance from Gragas must surely foreshadow drinking and destruction\u2014in that order.<br /><br />The only thing more important to Gragas than fighting is drinking. His unquenchable thirst for stronger ale has led him in search of the most potent and unconventional ingredients to toss in his still. Impulsive and unpredictable, this rowdy carouser loves cracking kegs as much as cracking heads. Thanks to his strange brews and temperamental nature, drinking with Gragas is always a risky proposition.<br /><br />Gragas has an eternal love of good drink, but his massive constitution prevented him from reaching a divine state of intoxication. One night, when he had drained all the kegs and was left wanting, Gragas was struck by a thought rather than the usual barstool: why couldn\'t he brew himself something that would finally get him truly drunk? It was then that he vowed to create the ultimate ale.<br /><br />Gragas\' quest eventually brought him to the Freljord, where the promise of acquiring the purest arctic water for his recipe led him into uncharted glacial wastes. While lost in an unyielding blizzard, Gragas stumbled upon a great howling abyss. There he found it: a flawless shard of ice unlike anything he had ever seen. Not only did this unmelting shard imbue his lager with incredible properties, but it also had a handy side effect - it kept the mixture chilled at the perfect serving temperature.<br /><br />Under the spell of his new concoction, Gragas headed for civilization, eager to share the fermented fruits of his labor. As fate would have it, the first gathering to catch Gragas\' bleary eyes would shape the future of the Freljord. He blundered into a deteriorating negotiation between two tribes discussing an alliance with <br />Ashe. Though Ashe welcomed a break in the tension, the other warriors bristled at the intrusion and hurled insults at the drunken oaf. True to his nature, Gragas replied with a diplomatic headbutt, setting off a brawl matched only in the legends of the Freljord.<br /><br />When the fallen from that great melee finally awoke, Ashe proposed a friendly drink as an alternative to fighting. With their tempers doused in suds, the two tribes, formerly on the brink of war, bonded over a common love of Gragas\' brew. Although strife was averted and Gragas hailed a hero, he still had not achieved his dream of drunken blissfulness. So once more, he set off to wander the tundra in search of ingredients for Runeterra\'s perfect pint.","stories":["A WELL-EARNED TIP<br />Up in the mountains that separate Demacia from the Freljord, there aren\u2019t a lot of jobs that pay coin. Some pay in furs, or in loaves of frost-hard bread... But Aegil\u2019s baby sister was born sickly. The family needed coin to keep her well-fed, and to buy her medicine.<br /><br />So Aegil\u2019s father cut a deal with Aegil\u2019s uncle, Jasper. Aegil would become a servant in Jasper\u2019s inn at the mountain pass, selling ale to passing traders.<br /><br />\\"Work hard, all right?\\" Aegil\u2019s mother told him. \\"For your sister.\\"<br /><br />One night, a season after Aegil started working for Jasper, a whole crowd of customers arrived just as the inn was closing. It was strange for travelers to arrive so late after nightfall in the winter.<br /><br />Jasper peered out the window. \\"I don\u2019t know them,\\" he said, tugging nervously on his wild black beard.<br /><br />The door slammed open and a crowd of shaggy-haired men thumped inside, shaking the snow from their boots and cloaks. They parted ranks, and an old fellow with a velvet-trimmed cloak approached the bar.<br /><br />\\"Good evening,\\" he said with a Great City accent. \\"Our business associate is arriving in a few minutes. What\u2019s on offer?\\"<br /><br />Uncle Jasper pointed numbly at the drink list hanging behind the bar. There were twelve brews there\u2014an impressive selection for this part of the Demacian hinterlands. But one by one, the guards all ordered the absolute cheapest: Forsyn\u2019s Red. Aegil had never tasted any other beer, but even he knew it wasn\u2019t good stuff. That\u2019s why it was so cheap.<br /><br />Aegil hurried into the back room where the kegs were kept to pour their ale. As the skunky beverage foamed into the cups, he wondered how much these guests would tip. Would he get one big tip from the leader, or eleven small tips, one from each? His heart raced.<br /><br />Then Aegil heard a heavy step on the path outside. The door creaked open... and the next step made the tavern floorboards groan.<br /><br />Aegil wheeled the drink cart out into the main room. The newcomer was the absolute biggest man he\u2019d ever seen. His head scraped the ceiling beams. His limbs were pure muscle, as thick as tree trunks, and his face was covered in a bristly red beard. The grisly scars criss-crossing his vast sides looked like he\u2019d really lived through the gruesome battles Jasper\u2019s drunken patrons liked to brag about.<br /><br />The velvet-clad man raised his hand toward the stranger. \\"Gragas, I presume?\\" he called.<br /><br />Gragas didn\u2019t answer. His eyes were fixed on the drinks list hanging behind the bar.<br /><br />\\"You are Gragas? The brewer?\\" the merchant repeated impatiently.<br /><br />Gragas turned his huge shoulders and gave the little old man a red-faced glare. With a voice so loud it reminded Aegil of an old god speaking from below the snowpack, the newcomer growled, \\"I\'m buyin\u2019 a drink.\\"<br /><br />The air in the room felt like it does when a thunderstorm gathers overhead. Aegil began handing out the ales. His hands were shaking.<br /><br />\\"What\u2019s that \u2018Karsten-Flower\u2019 stuff?\\" Gragas asked Jasper, pointing at the list. \\"What flower\u2019s that?\\"<br /><br />\\"That\u2019s just the brewer\u2019s name,\\" Jasper said. \\"It ain\u2019t got flowers in it. Sorry.\\"<br /><br />\\"Hmmm,\\" Gragas rumbled.<br /><br />Aegil handed out the final drink to the old merchant, then stood patiently, waiting for his tip... but the merchant ignored him. His glinting gaze was fixed on the huge newcomer\u2014like a fox\u2019s eyes before the pounce.<br /><br />\\"I\u2019ll take... the Sungold Porter,\\" Gragas announced. \\"That\u2019s a precious one, I\u2019ve heard.\\" Jasper scurried into the back to pour it, and Gragas thumped over to the table to sit down. \\"Now, what d\u2019ya have for me?\\" he asked.<br /><br />The old merchant started digging around in his huge coat. \\"I heard you\u2019re in the market for Shuriman goods,\\" he said. \\"Floodplain grains. Cactus blooms.\\"<br /><br />\\"I\u2019m... innerested,\\" Gragas said.<br /><br />The merchant noticed Aegil standing there. \\"Shoo, boy,\\" he said.<br /><br />Aegil froze. No tip?<br /><br />\\"I said shoo,\\" the merchant snapped. All the guards laughed.<br /><br />Tears starting at the corners of his eyes, Aegil hurried into the keg room behind the bar. Jasper was pacing back there, tugging nervously at his beard.<br /><br />\\"Damn that man,\\" Jasper seethed. \\"The Sungold Porter? I don\u2019t have any!\\"<br /><br />\\"We ran out?\\"<br /><br />\\"We never had it! I can\u2019t afford to stock any of those rare ales. They\u2019re on offer to impress people. Almost nobody orders them\u2014they\u2019re too expensive! And when they do, I just mix some stuff together! Nobody can tell!\\"<br /><br />To Aegil, this seemed like stealing. \\"You should tell the big man,\\" he said.<br /><br />Jasper laughed. \\"Why? It doesn\u2019t hurt anyone. I have a business to run, boy! One glass of the porter is a week of earnings here at the inn.\\" Jasper squared his shoulders. \\"He won\u2019t be able to tell.\\"<br /><br />Jasper snatched a massive stein off one of the hooks on the wall and started filling it at the Forsyn\u2019s tap... then Eigen Ale... then Karsten-Flower.<br /><br />As that murky mixture foamed toward the brim, Aegil realized he\u2019d have to deliver Gragas the concocted drink. Cold washed over him like a night wind over the snow. When Jasper thunked the stein into his outstretched hands, he almost fell over.<br /><br />\\"Keep a straight face!\\" Jasper ordered.<br /><br />Aegil thought of his sister. He thought of money clinking in his palm. Then he tottered forward across the empty floor of the inn, struggling to hold the stein aloft.<br /><br />Gragas\u2019 booming voice filled the room. \\"...The recipe I\u2019m working on has a very spicy taste already. I need somethin\u2019 to balaa mance it out.\\"<br /><br />As Aegil approached the table, the merchant leaned forward. \\"So. We arrive at the real business.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yeah,\\" Gragas grunted. \\"The real business.\\"<br /><br />The merchant reached inside his coat and drew out a palm-sized lockbox covered in gold and glinting jewels.<br /><br />The shining box was absolutely the most valuable thing Aegil had ever seen in his life\u2014it was probably worth ten lifetimes of Jasper\u2019s smelly ale. Standing near it felt like standing beside the sun.<br /><br />\\"Azir\u2019s Tears,\\" the merchant said. \\"Ancient heirloom spice. Ground from tomb-herbs found only in the ruins of the Sun Disc. The Sun Emperors used it to season their mead.\\"<br /><br />\\"Really...\\" Gragas said.<br /><br />\\"When I heard about your quest\u2014the greatest ale ever brewed! Well, I immediately sought out the Tears. The trades I had to make! The spice is worth a fortune, but I knew you\u2019d be good for it.\\"<br /><br />Gragas nodded slowly, thinking. Aegil suddenly realized that if anyone was going to be able to notice a substitute drink it would be a master brewer on a quest to make the perfect beer. He reached for the stein, thinking frantically of an excuse\u2014<br /><br />But he was too slow. Gragas noticed Aegil, and the beer sitting at his elbow. \\"Thanks, boy,\\" he said, and grabbed the stein himself.<br /><br />He drank deep\u2014and immediately, Aegil saw his bushy eyebrows furrow. His nostril twitched. His bearded lip curled into a hint of a grimace. His gaze traveled across the room... and fixed on Jasper.<br /><br />Aegil felt like he was going to melt. He knows we\u2019re tricking him!<br /><br />But the master brewer did not shout out his displeasure. Instead, Gragas held his hand out for the jeweled box.<br /><br />\\"So lemme see,\\" he said. \\"Show me your perfect spices.\\"<br /><br />The merchant handed it over. Gragas lifted the lid of the lockbox and sniffed.<br /><br />And again, his nostril twitched. That sensitive sense of smell had found another flavor that troubled it.<br /><br />Aegil felt his heart stop. They\u2019re tricking him too. It\u2019s a FAKE!<br /><br />One forgery was forgivable. Two? Over the same pint? Not as much. Gragas glanced at Aegil\u2014just for a moment.<br /><br />It was warning enough. Aegil dove away from the table like a snow hare leaping for the safety of the treeline.<br /><br />Then Gragas stood. He flipped the table as he rose, and simultaneously, each one of the guards produced jagged hatchets from beneath their cloaks.<br /><br />Gragas just took out his fists.<br /><br />Aegil saw only bits of the ensuing fight. He saw the merchant flee toward the bar... then Gragas followed with huge strides. There was a sound like an explosion. Jasper gave a high-pitched scream and skittered straight out the front door. Then the kegs all rolled across the floor toward the guards, a thundering avalanche spraying ale and foam in every direction. It flattened them\u2014all but one, who hid behind a table, then popped up, ready to throw his axe\u2014<br /><br />But Gragas grunted, a barrel flew across the room, and the guard simply vanished. So did half of the back wall. Aegil heard the guard\u2019s tiny scream disappear down the mountainside.<br /><br />Aegil crawled out from under a table to see Gragas pouring the grey, dusty contents of the shiny lockbox onto the groaning merchant at his feet.<br /><br />\\"Mummy dust,\\" he growled. \\"Have some respect!\\"<br /><br />Then he caught sight of Aegil. His wild brows narrowed. \\"Boy,\\" he called. His booming voice made shards of broken glass tremble on the floor. \\"Come here!\\"<br /><br />Cautiously, Aegil approached. He thought of his sister. He wondered whether he could run faster than a thrown barrel.<br /><br />\\"Tell the innkeep to go lighter on the Forsyn\u2019s next time,\\" Gragas said.<br /><br />Then Aegil saw the lockbox in the master brewer\u2019s outstretched hand. A huge smile parted that bushy red beard.<br /><br />\\"Yer tip.\\""]},"table":{"name":"Gragas","image":"gragas.png","general":{"Title":"The Rabble Rouser","Pronouns":"He/Him","Release date":"February 2nd, 2010","Cost":"3150 790","Primary":"Fighter","Secondary":"Mage"},"statistics":{"HP":"600 (+95)","HPR":"5.5 (+0.5)","MP":"400 (+47)","MPR":"6 (+0.8)","MS":"330","AD":"64 (+3.5)","AS":"0.675 (+2.05%)","RNG":"125","AR":"38 (+3.6)","MR":"32.1 (+1.25)"}},"abilities":[{"key":"Passive","name":"Happy Hour","img":"happy_hour.png","description":"Innate: On ability use, Gragas takes a drink restoring <span class=\'hpConversion\'>[+8% his max]</span>.
