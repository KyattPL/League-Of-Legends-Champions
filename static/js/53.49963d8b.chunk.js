Her experiences have made her a deadly hunter and, to some, the harbinger of a future they would rather not live to see. Having entered into an uneasy symbiosis with a living Void carapace, the time will soon come when she must decide whether to forgive those mortals who would call her a monster, and defeat the coming darkness together\u2026 or simply to forget, as the Void consumes the world that left her behind.<br />Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the fearless hunter of the Void known as Kai\u2019Sa is how unremarkably her life began. She did not descend from tribal warriors hardened by generations of battle, nor was she summoned from distant lands to fight the unknowable menace lurking beneath Shurima. Rather, she was just an ordinary girl, born to loving parents who called the unforgiving southern deserts their home. This was where she would spend her days playing with friends, and her nights dreaming about her place in the world.<br /><br />In her tenth summer, the young girl Kaisa\u2019s destiny would be changed forever. Had she been older, she might have noticed more of the unusual events that had begun to unfold in the villages\u2014every day, her mother urged her stay home, for fear of strangers wandering the land, demanding tribute to dark powers below. Kaisa and her friends did not believe it, until one evening they came upon a pen of sacrificial goats bought from nomad herdsmen. Using the knife her father had given her on her eighth birthday, she cut their tethers and set the animals free into a nearby canyon. It seemed like a harmless prank, until the unthinkable happened. The ground began to quake, flashes of light scorched the sky, and the children ran for their lives.<br /><br />The Void had been awakened. A great rift split the bedrock, swallowing up Kaisa\u2019s village and everyone in it, leaving nothing behind but sand pierced with twisted columns as black as night.<br /><br />Kaisa regained consciousness to find herself trapped underground. She was filled with crippling fear, but there was still hope; she could hear the faint cries of other survivors. They called out to each other feebly, repeating their names one by one like a mantra. Sadly, by the third day, hers was the only voice left. Her friends and family were all gone. She was alone in the darkness.<br /><br />It was only when all seemed lost that she saw the light.<br /><br />She followed it down.<br /><br />Along the way, she found meager sustenance. Amid the debris left by the collapse were ragged waterskins, rotting peaches\u2014anything to keep starvation at bay. But, eventually, Kaisa\u2019s hunger was replaced by fear once again. She found herself in a vast cavern, illuminated by an otherworldly purplish glow, and she could see she was no longer alone.<br /><br />Skittering creatures swarmed in the depths. The first that came for Kaisa was no bigger than her, and she clutched her knife in both hands, ready to defend herself. The voidling horror knocked her to the ground, but she drove the blade into its pulsing heart, and the two of them tumbled deeper into the abyss.<br /><br />The creature was seemingly dead, but its unnatural skin had taken hold upon the flesh of her arm. The dark shell tingled, but was hard as steel to the touch. In a panic, Kaisa broke her knife trying to remove it. But when the larger beasts came, she used it as a shield to make her escape.<br /><br />Soon enough, she realized the shell was becoming part of her. As her daily struggle to survive drew out into years, this second skin grew with her, and so too did her resolve.<br /><br />Now she had more than hope, she had a plan. Fight hard. Stay alive. Find a way back.<br /><br />She was transformed, from frightened girl to fearless survivor, from prey to predator. For almost a decade, she has lived between two worlds in an attempt to keep them apart\u2014the Void hungers to consume not only the scattered villages of Shurima, but the whole of Runeterra. She will not allow that to happen.<br /><br />Though she has slain countless Void-constructs, she understands that many of the people she protects would see her as a monster herself. Indeed, her name has begun to pass into legend, an echo of the ancient horrors of doomed Icathia.<br /><br />No longer Kaisa\u2026 but Kai\u2019Sa.","stories":["THE GIRL WHO CAME BACK<br />\\"Listen to me,\\" I tell the little girl who found me here, beside the pit. \\"I need you to hear me. There isn\u2019t much time.\\"<br /><br />She leans forward, without a hint of fear in her eyes. \\"Tell me what to do.\\"<br /><br />I like her. A slight smile breaks across my face, for the first time in what seems like\u2026 forever. \\"Not this,\\" I say, gesturing to the arrow gripped in her hand. She holds it like a spear.<br /><br />I was only a child when the Void took me from my family, so I didn\u2019t know any better either. But the rest of them, they were so careless. Sacrifices, offerings, tributes\u2014whatever you want to call them, they were never going to work. It isn\u2019t some god, appeased by gifts and prayers. It just wants to devour everything.<br /><br />\\"You want to kill it? You want to destroy it?\\" I ask her.<br /><br />She nods.<br /><br />\\"Then starve it.\\"<br /><br />The sensation of needles on my flesh grows stronger, as if in response to these words. The threatening presence is closing in around us, and my second skin constricts, pulling taut as a bow. I take one last deep breath before they come.<br /><br />The sand begins to shift, puckering and falling away, like in an hourglass. Eerie pulses of light filter into the sky, as the construct-creatures heave themselves up into the Shuriman night, screeching and drooling. I steady myself, charging the energy inside my shoulder pods.<br /><br />I grit my teeth, and release it.<br /><br />Bright blooms of heat and pain find their targets quickly, raining down, stopping the creatures in their tracks, flinging them aside. The air is filled with an acid reek, and the hiss of melting chitin.<br /><br />Soon there is nothing left of them. I wait for the needles\u2019 itch to stop, but it doesn\u2019t.<br /><br />The girl is crouched beside me, ready. She probably cannot understand what she is seeing.<br /><br />\\"Does it hurt?\\" she whispers, her hand reaching out for the glowing scales on my arm.<br /><br />I pull back reflexively. She doesn\u2019t even flinch.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes,\\" I confess.<br /><br />Not too far away, her village sleeps on unaware, for the most part. Curiosity had no doubt gotten the better of this little girl. So many stories, fables both frightening and fantastical. The voidling beasts hunting in the dead of night, calling to one another.<br /><br />She just wanted to see for herself. See what lurks beyond the rocks, see the thing her people both fear and adore at the same time.<br /><br />My skin tightens again. The needles, the constant itch\u2026<br /><br />I blink. \\"I\u2019m sorry, you didn\u2019t tell me your name.\\"<br /><br />She stands up proudly, still brandishing the arrow. \\"I\u2019m Illi. I came to protect my family from the monster.\\" She is no more than ten years of age.<br /><br />\\"Well, Illi\u2014sometimes running is the best thing to do.\\"<br /><br />\\"But you don\u2019t run,\\" she says, narrowing her eyes, \\"do you?\\"<br /><br />A clever one, this girl. I shake my head. \\"Not anymore.\\"<br /><br />\\"Then I won\u2019t either!\\" Illi proclaims. Brave as well.<br /><br />She has no idea what they\u2019re dealing with. None of them do. All these things her people have done to rid themselves of the creatures, they were just ringing the dinner bell.<br /><br />\\"You need to tell them, Illi. You need to make them understand. No more dancing beneath the new moon. And no more animals tied to stakes. The Void has no mercy to offer\u2014it feeds or it dies.\\"<br /><br />The day I came to understand this, was when I knew I had a chance. Maybe that\u2019s why I survive, while so many others perish.<br /><br />But survival always has its price. Ever since I found my way back, I\u2019ve been paying it.<br /><br />\\"Look\u2026\\" the girl whispers. \\"They are coming to find us.\\"<br /><br />I don\u2019t have to look. I knew they would come. By instinct, the carapace draws over my face. Illi stares up at me.<br /><br />\\"Don\u2019t be frightened,\\" I say to her in a voice now so twisted and monstrous, it could have the opposite meaning.<br /><br />\\"Of what?\\" she asks. I find myself wearing a smile she cannot see.<br /><br />There are only a handful of people who\u2019ve ever seen me in the flesh, or whatever it is that now covers my body. All but two of them are dead.<br /><br />Illi\u2019s people appear to be capable hunters. Only the capable live out here. I can see where she got her bravery. Their torches twinkle in the night.<br /><br />\\"Papa!\\" she calls out to the searching villagers, without warning me. \\"I found her! The girl who came back!\\"<br /><br />They\u2019re heading toward us now, weapons at the ready, fire in their eyes. \\"Illi!\\" her father yells, nocking an arrow to his bow. \\"Get away from that... thing!\\"<br /><br />She looks up at me again, confused. For every little girl like Illi, there are ten others who would run the other way. Or worse. I know what most people say about me. I\u2019ve seen their fear scrawled across mud walls, scratched into the canyon rocks.<br /><br />Beware the girl who came back a monster.<br /><br />They don\u2019t know a thing about me. To them, I\u2019m just something they do not want to face\u2014a living, walking, fighting embodiment of what they fear most. I guess that\u2019s why they added the mark to my name.<br /><br />Ten years ago, I was only Kaisa\u2014very much like Illi, hopeful about a future as limitless as the stars in the night sky. That future died the day the Void dragged me down.<br /><br />The needles are back. Illi releases my hand just as my luminous weapons materialize over my arms. \\"Go to him,\\" I tell her. \\"Go to your father.\\"<br /><br />\\"Illi, run!\\" her father pleads. He draws back his bowstring with trembling hands.<br /><br />\\"No!\\" she yells, turning to me. \\"I don\u2019t run anymore.\\"<br /><br />I usher her forwards, keeping my eyes trained on the villagers. \\"No, Illi, you were born a fighter. They will need you.\\"<br /><br />After a few steps, she turns back. \\"What do I tell them?\\"<br /><br />\\"Tell them... Tell them to be ready.\\"<br /><br />The Void has taken so much from me, but I refuse to let it take everything. These moments, where kindness and humanity shine through, where innocence and trust extinguish fear\u2014they fill me with hope that we can defeat the rivers of timeless poison that flow beneath the world.<br /><br />The first time I escaped the abyss, I did it for myself.<br /><br />Maybe one day, it will be for them.","MONSTROUS<br />There\u2019s light under the earth, if you know where to look.<br /><br />If you know how to look.<br /><br />I don\u2019t need light to see. Not anymore.<br /><br />My eyes only ever saw in degrees of darkness, but the sight I now have shows me much more than I ever knew was possible. Now, I perceive colors that don\u2019t exist in nature, as well as hues and shades that reveal how the walls keeping the monsters out aren\u2019t solid at all\u2014they\u2019re as thin as a painted backcloth hung by a performing troupe.<br /><br />Sometimes I wish I didn\u2019t see the things I do, but then I remember that I\u2019d have died a long time ago if I hadn\u2019t adapted to life down here.<br /><br />And sometimes I wonder if dying would have been better.<br /><br />The man I\u2019m dragging behind me doesn\u2019t see like I do. In fact, he\u2019s pretty much blind in the darkness. The only light is the faint glow smoldering in the bulbous pods growing out of my shoulders.<br /><br />Not nearly enough light for human eyes to see clearly, at least not at the speed we\u2019re moving.<br /><br />He\u2019s scared and stumbling with every step he takes.<br /><br />Down here he\u2019s nothing, but on the surface he\u2019s a leader, the hetman of a desert settlement.<br /><br />That\u2019s why I took him. He needs to see the danger of what\u2019s down here, to fully understand how much danger his people are in.<br /><br />I\u2019m half dragging, half lifting him, which would be hard if it wasn\u2019t for the strength my living armor gives me.<br /><br />It clings to my skin, all across my body, as if a thousand tiny hooks are digging into my flesh. I\u2019m not even sure where its undulant yet rigid surface ends and I begin, anymore. It used to be painful, and I used to hate the rasping, cat\u2019s-tongue feel of it enfolding me.<br /><br />But now I don\u2019t mind it at all, because it means I\u2019m never truly alone.<br /><br />I used to think I could hear it whispering in my head as it grew and spread across my body, but I think that was just my own voice trying to keep me from going mad from pain and loneliness.<br /><br />At least, I hope that\u2019s what it was.<br /><br />The rock beneath me is smooth and glassy, made so not by the flow of molten rock, but by the passage of the things that live deep in the earth as they ooze up from below like worms through a rotten honeyfruit.<br /><br />The people on the surface name this underworld by what it does, by what it is.<br /><br />Void.<br /><br />I\u2019ve been down here long enough to know that name doesn\u2019t even begin to capture the true threat and horror of what lurks in the darkness below\u2014of what the Void really is. The monsters that reach the surface to hunt and kill are just the vanguard of what lives beyond, and they aren\u2019t like anything the people above can understand.<br /><br />If they really knew the truth, they\u2019d never come within a thousand miles of where Icathia once stood, but mortals are so very good at forgetting. The passing of years lessens the horrors of the past. What was learned in blood and suffering now lingers mostly in travelers\u2019 scary stories told around a fire, or in folk traditions. Hang some Pearls of the Moon over your hearth, say a prayer to Nasus to watch over your home, or leave some goats out to appease the beasts\u2019 monstrous hunger.<br /><br />But the creatures of the Void aren\u2019t like ordinary predators.<br /><br />When I was little more than a babe in arms, I remember seeing a swarm of pack-hunting kmiros bring down a wounded skallashi. I cried my eyes out, but I didn\u2019t hate the kmiros for killing the gentle giant. It was just their nature. The creatures of the surface kill to eat. They\u2019re hungry, not evil.<br /><br />The Voidborn will kill you just because you\u2019re alive.<br /><br />\\"Please,\\" begs the man behind me. I\u2019d almost forgotten I had hold of him. \\"Please let me go.\\"<br /><br />He lets out a wracking sob as I stop and press him hard against the wall.<br /><br />I can\u2019t decide if he thinks I\u2019m going to kill him or let him go.<br /><br />A violet glow swells around my hands, lambent blades of killing light.<br /><br />Their sudden appearance shifts my vision and I see the radiant threads of magic in his blood as it flows around his body.<br /><br />Wisps of it lift into the air with every panicked breath and every tear that rolls down his cheeks. It\u2019s faint, almost nothing, but the Void predators will sense it, and be drawn like sand-flies to dung.<br /><br />My armored skin wants to feed on him, and I recoil as I realize a part of me wants to as well.<br /><br />He\u2019s weak, like everyone on the surface. It would be a mercy to just plunge my blades of light into his body than to have his soul be unmade by the monsters below.<br /><br />No! I protect the people on the surface. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the girl who came back.<br /><br />I push down the murderous urges of the suit, and the glow fades from my stiffened fingers. I take a shuddering breath, closing them into fists.<br /><br />My vision returns to normal, and I look around to see we\u2019re not where I thought we\u2019d be.<br /><br />We\u2019re much closer to the surface than I expected, which makes what I\u2019m seeing doubly dangerous. The rock of the tunnel shimmers like a cave ceiling over an underground lake, rippling with light from a dimension unknown to the races of the surface.<br /><br />We\u2019re at the edge of a depthless abyss where the boundaries of two realms ebb and flow like the sand seas at Zoantha. It looks like a glowing ocean of sickly light, swirling in a constant state of unraveling and renewal. It churns with titanic energies that sometimes form hideous outlines\u2014like the submerged leviathans said to dwell beneath oceans I\u2019ve only ever heard about in stories.<br /><br />It\u2019s dangerous to be this close, but I need this man to see.<br /><br />Soulless, black eyes coalesce to stare up from below.<br /><br />Spirals of matter take horrid shape.<br /><br />Hunched spines unfold, grasping limbs stretch, and hooked claws form in the liquid insanity, lunatic evolution weaving translucent monsters into being with shrieking, piercing birth-screams.<br /><br />They\u2019re here\u2026<br /><br />\\"Open your eyes,\\" I tell the hetman.<br /><br />My voice is distorted through the molded mask of the suit\u2014a wet, animal snarl that sounds like no mortal tongue. He shakes his head. He can\u2019t understand me.<br /><br />The words sound like I\u2019m choking on blood.<br /><br />With a thought, the chitinous plates of my helm peel back, sliding over one another as they unfold like the carapace of an insect retracting its wings.<br /><br />\\"Open your eyes,\\" I say again, and this time he understands.<br /><br />He lets out a cry of fear as he sees my human face.<br /><br />What do I look like now?<br /><br />Am I so different than I was? Do I look like I belong down here?<br /><br />I have not seen my face in such a long time. I hope it still looks like I remember.<br /><br />The light swells and he turns toward the abyss.The swarming, growing things within it are reaching up to us, and his eyes widen in fear as he finally sees why I brought him here.<br /><br />Thousands of chittering monsters, rising from an ocean of madness that reaches to the heart of the world and beyond. I don\u2019t know what it really is or where it comes from.<br /><br />All I know is that it births an endless horde of misbegotten nightmares that claw their way up through the rock with the implacable urge to kill and unmake the world above.<br /><br />Their tide is on the rise, and I\u2019m the only one who can stop it.<br /><br />I lean close to the man and say, \\"Do you see them? Do you understand?\\"<br /><br />He nods in terror and I let him go.<br /><br />I watch the hetman scramble up to the light of the surface, then turn as I hear the scrape of claws on rock behind me. Arms that would be impossible in nature hook over the edge of the abyss, dragging a monstrous horror of rasping armor plates, bony protrusions, and flesh the color of something stillborn. It\u2019s still wet and glistening from its arrival into this world, but it has infinite malice in the black eyes that ripple to life on its upper carapace. Blade limbs unfold from its pallid belly, and a lipless mouth tears open across its throat, a wide gash of gleaming white fangs and drooling ichor.<br /><br />Others quickly follow it, smaller, but just as vicious. Their very presence distorts the air, and slivers of dissolving matter rise like black smoke from the rock beneath their claws.<br /><br />The stink of their nearness is horrifying, and furnace heat spreads throughout my body.<br /><br />Threat response fills my limbs with power.<br /><br />Once, I fought such urges, but I understand now that they kept me alive, that they allow me to fight back.<br /><br />The carapace mask draws down over my face. My vision shifts again.<br /><br />It used to be jarring, this transition, but now I welcome it.<br /><br />I see in light. In life and my prey\u2019s vulnerabilities. I am a predator again.<br /><br />The plates molded to my shoulders shift and reshape as the glowing pods snap up. Blinding light builds within them, and I shriek as a painful flurry of searing bolts streak toward the creatures.<br /><br />The smaller ones instantly detonate in explosions of purple fluids and unnatural flesh.<br /><br />Their blood splashes me, and the curved plates of my armor greedily drink it in.<br /><br />My gorge rises in disgust, even as it nourishes me.<br /><br />I sprint forward, snapping my arms out and wreathing my hands in blades of light. I vault into the air, pushing off the tunnel wall to blast the larger horror with pulsing streams of violet fire. Its body tears open and tar-black ichor spills out.<br /><br />It screeches in pain, lashing out with its impossibly angled limbs.<br /><br />I land in their midst and roll under its blades, rising to a crouch and unleashing another stream of bolts. They burn its flesh with incandescent fury, as though fire conjured from their own kind is more lethal than any other.<br /><br />I flip backward as its body crashes down, but it\u2019s not dead\u2026 whatever that means to the Voidborn.<br /><br />It draws the blood of the smaller creatures up into its limbs, drinking their very essence. Webs of light and twitching matter knit its flesh together, like a weaver sewing a torn blanket. Its huge bulk convulses, rippling as it reforms wounded flesh and pushes out new limbs, hardening areas of weakness. Burning tendrils of dark light spray from its splitting flesh, cracking like whips against the ground.<br /><br />Solid rock runs like wax as its very permanence is undone. One lash glances against my knee, and I stumble as a portion of my armor bleeds off in a bloom of black smoke.<br /><br />I see my skin beneath, bleached of life and vitality, like the blind reptiles that make their burrows beneath the desert crags. It sickens me to see it, but I can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s because the flesh looks dead, or because it reminds me of what I used to be.<br /><br />The thought has slowed me.<br /><br />Only for an instant, but that\u2019s enough. The Voidlings and hunter creatures swarm me.<br /><br />A thing almost twice my size barrels me from my feet. Its claws tear at my chest, its teeth snapping shut over my head. Its teeth cut deep grooves in my faceplate, and I look down its thrashing, tooth-filled gullet as its proboscis tongue seeks a way in.<br /><br />I jam my fists against its body and blast a torrent of purple fire into its body until it can contain no more. It explodes in a welter of bony cartilage and unnatural meat, and my suit feeds on the unleashed energies of its death.<br /><br />Claws and teeth slash and bite. I roll aside, more violet flame jetting from my hands. I leap and twist away from their attacks. Sheer weight of numbers works in their favor, and more of the creatures are swarming over the edge of the abyss.<br /><br />A boiling tide of organic plates, claws and fury that will swiftly overwhelm me.<br /><br />My shoulder pods erupt with increasingly powerful streams of killing fire, but it won\u2019t be enough to stop them. I don\u2019t know if the Void is capable of hate, but I feel like these monsters hate me. They see me as something of their world, but also as something they must destroy.<br /><br />I wonder if their perception of me is so different from that of the people above.<br /><br />They surround me, and I remember the skallashi brought down by the kmiros.<br /><br />But I am no prey animal. I can fight back.<br /><br />I spin on my heel, drawing a ring of purple fire around me with my burning fists.<br /><br />Its power drives them back, giving me space to breathe. I see a path, and take it. I weave through them, leaving a trail of sundered bodies in my wake. My speed is uncanny. I see the creatures around me moving as if they\u2019re in a stupor. They can\u2019t keep up with me, and I kill them with every pummeling blast of flame and every strike of my fire-bladed hands.<br /><br />Then I\u2019m clear.<br /><br />Turning, I sprint from the abyss.<br /><br />Not so fast as to lose them, but fast enough to stay ahead.<br /><br />I lose track of time.<br /><br />Down in the dark, that\u2019s easy to do.<br /><br />I sometimes forget what the sun looks like, or how we used to follow the shadows to know what part of the day we were in.<br /><br />For someone born of the burning sands to forget the sun makes me want to cry. I have memories of its blazing light reflecting on water, of a golden eye in the sky, and joyous heat filling my chest with every breath.<br /><br />But they don\u2019t feel connected to me anymore.<br /><br />It\u2019s like I\u2019m remembering a thing someone told me, not something I knew or felt myself.<br /><br />I push the memories away.<br /><br />They\u2019re distractions that\u2019ll slow me down and get me killed.<br /><br />But I can\u2019t help it. The core of me, the part that\u2019s still a little girl, keeps showing me these things, keeps trying to remind me of who I used to be.<br /><br />The creatures from the abyss are still after me, filling the tunnels behind me with their screeching, clawing bodies. I\u2019ve been leading them away from where I let the hetman go, drawing them into the deeper desert, back toward the lost land they came from.<br /><br />I\u2019ve done this many times before, and this won\u2019t be the last time.<br /><br />I fight and I run, never letting them surround me.<br /><br />It\u2019s a dance.One that never ends.<br /><br />Their hunger is palpable. I\u2019ve killed so many of them, but there\u2019s always more.<br /><br />I try not to think of their endless numbers. To think too much about that would sap my will to fight, and I can\u2019t let that happen. Not while there\u2019s still people in the world above I care about.<br /><br />Like the sun, their names and faces are drifting further away from me.<br /><br />But I know they\u2019re still above me. I go there sometimes, just to remember what it feels like to see the sky above me. Or to breathe air that isn\u2019t wet with the bitter flavor of somewhere terrible and utterly hostile. It\u2019s been a long time since I ventured to the surface. The longer I spend there, the more I feel its air start to burn me. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m becoming more used to the darkness, that the sunlit world above doesn\u2019t want me anymore.<br /><br />I remember when I met a girl up there.<br /><br />She was young, like I was once, and she didn\u2019t hate me. She saw what I was and she didn\u2019t run in terror like most people do. She saw who I used to be, but that\u2019s not what most people see.<br /><br />They see the suit, and feel its primal urge to unmake them simmering behind my eyes.<br /><br />They can\u2019t help it, and I don\u2019t hate them for it, but it hurts.<br /><br />It hurts to know I used to be just like them, and now\u2026<br /><br />Now I don\u2019t know what I am.<br /><br />But for all that I\u2019ve changed and become something they hate and fear, I\u2019m still holding on to what makes me human. If I can just hold on to the part of me that was a little girl once, I can turn the awful things that have happened to me into something good, something noble.<br /><br />But I can feel it slipping away.<br /><br />What will I be when I can\u2019t remember her?<br /><br />A change comes over the Void creatures.<br /><br />I sense it almost immediately, a turn in their purpose. It\u2019s hard to know what changes, but it\u2019s clear that their pursuit of me has shifted, like they don\u2019t care about me anymore.<br /><br />Like they have better target for their ferocious urge to destroy.<br /><br />A terrible suspicion fills me, and I surge away from the creatures behind me.<br /><br />My armor makes me faster than them, and I move through the tunnels like a ghost, taking the crooked paths that only I know about. I feel the ferocity of the chase fade as I circle around, climbing back to the surface and feeling the hot tension of the world above.<br /><br />I\u2019d been trying to keep the monsters close to me, trying to lure them away from the settlements on the surface, but when I emerge into the sunlight through a hidden cleft at the top of a solitary spire of bare rock, I see how horribly wrong I\u2019ve been.<br /><br />I thought I was leading the monsters away, truly I did.<br /><br />A giant skull has been set upon a boulder atop the spire, a marker of sorts.<br /><br />It\u2019s a warning. A sign that these lands are not safe.<br /><br />I know that\u2019s what it is, because I put it here.<br /><br />One foot on the skull, I look down at a settlement full of people.<br /><br />My helm unfolds from over my face, and I see with my own eyes.<br /><br />Beneath me are neat and ordered streets, running between finely made buildings of sun-baked bricks. At the settlement\u2019s southern end are the silken awnings of a bustling market, and I see a disc of gold on the roof of what I think is a temple. The sounds of laughter drift up to me on the spire.<br /><br />I smell roasting meat, animal dung, and the heady aroma of spices.<br /><br />They are the smells of life, the everyday texture of the world above.<br /><br />For a second I\u2019m transported back to my half-forgotten youth, and the corners of my mouth curl in what might be a smile.<br /><br />Then I remember what lurks beneath the sands, and the half-formed smile falls from my face.<br /><br />My heart pounds in my chest and I fight to draw breath.<br /><br />Don\u2019t they know the danger they\u2019re in?<br /><br />The inner surfaces of my armor clamp down hard on my flesh, and I sink to one knee with the pain of it. It\u2019s hungry to feed, and I wonder how much of my path has been chosen by me, how much by its design.<br /><br />My senses are finely tuned to the denizens of the Void.<br /><br />They\u2019re close, so very close, and rising to the surface. Somewhere out in the desert.<br /><br />I feel the imminence of a breach like the pressure in the air before a storm.<br /><br />The mask slams back into place, filling my vision with patterns of light and heat.<br /><br />I look back to the settlement as I hear the clash of steel, and a shouting voice.<br /><br />My gaze drifts to a martial field set at the settlement\u2019s edge, where scores of armed men and women are lined up. I watch them, confused as to what they\u2019re doing until it hits me.<br /><br />They\u2019re training to fight.<br /><br />A man is shouting at them, filling their hearts with courage and their souls with fire.<br /><br />I can\u2019t hear his words, but I can see his face as clearly as if he were standing right next to me.<br /><br />It\u2019s the hetman I dragged below the earth.<br /><br />I vault from rock to rock as I make my way down to the settlement.<br /><br />The nearness of the Void creatures is a building pressure in my skull.<br /><br />It won\u2019t be long before they\u2019re here.<br /><br />I leap through an animal enclosure, scattering the livestock as they catch my scent, and panic.<br /><br />The people of the settlement don\u2019t notice me at first. Then I hear the cries of alarm spread as they see my armored form in their midst. I\u2019m heading straight for the hetman, and I already feel anger pounding in my veins.<br /><br />I showed him! Why didn\u2019t he listen? I took him to see the horrors below. I wanted him to feel the terror of their very existence and to carry that terror back to his people.<br /><br />But all I\u2019ve done is strengthened his resolve to stand and fight.<br /><br />Every person that dies here will be my fault. Their blood will be on my hands.<br /><br />I wanted to prevent this, but I\u2019ve made their deaths inevitable.<br /><br />Men and women scatter before me, terrified despite the weapons they carry. The hetman\u2019s face hardens. The last time I saw him, he was terrified, but his terror has turned to hate.<br /><br />His eyes tell me he thinks I\u2019m here to kill him, and maybe I am.<br /><br />My mask snaps open as I come to a halt before him.<br /><br />\\"Why are you still here?\\" I scream, tasting the hot desert air. Underneath the smells of the settlement, I feel the growing presence of the Void. It\u2019s like biting on a copper coin. \\"Go!\\"<br /><br />\\"Back, demon!\\" he snarls. \\"You are a herald of the beasts!\\"<br /><br />For a moment, his meaning is lost on me. Then I understand.<br /><br />\\"You think I bring the monsters\u2026?\\"<br /><br />\\"I know you,\\" he spits, advancing on me. \\"You are the Void\u2019s daughter. Wherever you walk, the monsters follow.\\"<br /><br />I shake my head, ready to throw his accusation back in his face\u2026<br /><br />Then I wonder if he\u2019s right.<br /><br />I fight the Voidborn wherever I can, wherever I find them.<br /><br />I hold my hand up before me, seeing the hair-fine threads of violet light shimmering in the sculpted plates of my armor. Until now, I have always thought it was part of me, that I controlled it, but what if my control isn\u2019t so complete as I thought? I assert my will, and the veins of light fade.<br /><br />Is it possible? Are the creatures of the Void drawn to me?<br /><br />No, I would know. I\u2019d know if I was somehow drawing them deeper into the world.<br /><br />My doubt turns to anger, and the blades of light brighten around my hands.<br /><br />\\"I escaped you once before,\\" said the hetman, raising his sword. \\"And we will fight the beasts you command.\\"<br /><br />\\"You escaped me?\\" I say, incredulous. \\"Is that what you think happened?\\"<br /><br />He swings his sword, but I block it easily. He\u2019s not skilled with a blade, and it\u2019s easy for me to dodge his attacks. I circle him as he swings again and again. The townsfolk are gathered around me, screaming at their leader to strike a deathblow. My armor responds to his every attack and their aggression, filling my body with the urge to fight, to kill.<br /><br />They see the second skin I wear, but they don\u2019t realize how much danger they\u2019re in right now.<br /><br />Not from the Void. From me.<br /><br />They can\u2019t see the girl beneath. They don\u2019t want to see her.<br /><br />It\u2019s easier for them to believe I\u2019m a monster.<br /><br />I feel anger and betrayal harden my heart to them. Why should I fight to save them? Why do I fight to hold on to my humanity, when it hurts so much to remember all I\u2019ve lost?<br /><br />Why not just become the monster they think I am?<br /><br />Wouldn\u2019t that be easier?<br /><br />But then I look beyond the hetman\u2019s angry face, to the grandparents watching from the doorways of the homes they built with their own two hands. To the young mothers clutching newborns to their breasts. And beyond even them, to the thousand daily displays of love and the small acts of kindness that go unnoticed every day in the world.<br /><br />That\u2019s why I fight the monsters.<br /><br />I stand for the people who cannot stand, because there\u2019s no one who fights quite like me.<br /><br />Because if I don\u2019t stand for them, who will?<br /><br />And what will be left of the girl who came back if I don\u2019t?<br /><br />But every war requires sacrifice. I\u2019ve made so many already\u2014now I know I need to make yet another. This time it won\u2019t be me that pays the blood price, but I\u2019ll carry it all the same.<br /><br />I turn a full circle. Everyone is looking to the hetman. He\u2019s their strength, the only reason they\u2019re still here. He\u2019s filled their hearts with courage and the will to fight an enemy that can\u2019t be fought, can\u2019t be bargained with, and which only gets stronger with every life it consumes.<br /><br />There\u2019s only one way to end this without everybody dying.<br /><br />I block yet another clumsy swing, and as his sword goes wide, I spin inside his guard to hammer my light-bladed fists against his chest.<br /><br />Searing energy pours into him, filling his body with light. His every vein, nerve ending, and bone burns with searing brilliance for an instant before his body explodes.<br /><br />It\u2019s awful, but I can\u2019t stop now. I feel the nearness of the Void as a terrible, twisting pain in my gut. The texture of the air abruptly changes, and I know the Void has climbed to the world above.<br /><br />It\u2019s on the surface and it\u2019s coming here now.<br /><br />I turn away from the molten, disintegrating ruin of the hetman as his body falls to the sand, barely recognizable as something that was once human. People scatter in terror as my shoulder pods slide up and fill with killing light. I feel the fiery pressure build within me, aching for release.<br /><br />I unleash a salvo of spiraling light, blasting a deserted grain store to blazing rubble. Burning seeds and baskets spill from the ruins. I obliterate the market with more flashing bolts, and the silk awnings rise up like the burning sails of a sand-clipper as they catch light.<br /><br />Purple-white fire streaks through the settlement and explodes with devastating force. People run screaming as I destroy their homes. They think I\u2019m trying to kill them, that I\u2019m doing this because I\u2019ve become something monstrous, but that\u2019s just not true.<br /><br />I only destroy buildings my helm\u2019s vision shows me are empty.<br /><br />I demolish unmanned walls and barricades\u2014anything that might give them hope they have a chance against the Void.<br /><br />I\u2019m not trying to kill them. I just want them to run.<br /><br />Night has fallen as I watch from the spire of rock above the burning settlement, one foot braced on the skull I left as a warning marker. The horde of Voidborn climbs toward me in a rush of snapping fangs, misshapen limbs, and inhuman forms.<br /><br />It sounds like a swarm of voracious insects devouring a harvest crop.<br /><br />There\u2019s too many to count, almost no way to tell where one beast ends and the next begins. It\u2019s just a mass of teeth and claws. Unbridled destruction given form.<br /><br />They sense my presence here, and I make no attempt to run.<br /><br />Because if they\u2019re coming for me, they\u2019re not going after the people of the settlement.<br /><br />The horizon burns with a sick light that doesn\u2019t belong in this world, and forking traceries of vivid, purple lightning flash up from the sundered ground deep in the desert.<br /><br />The settlement\u2019s inhabitants have long since fled, leading their animals behind colorful wagons bearing what possessions they couldn\u2019t bear to leave behind. They\u2019re already many miles west, moving in a long column like the dormun-riders of old.<br /><br />They\u2019ll follow the sand roads to the new-flowing waters, moving on until they can begin again.<br /><br />And that\u2019s the point. To begin again they need to be alive.<br /><br />I remember their faces as they looked back at their lost homes. They pointed to me high up on the spire, and cursed me. The memory of their faces still pains me. So full of fear and hatred.<br /><br />They\u2019ll carry that hate with them, telling stories of the forsaken girl who isn\u2019t a girl anymore. They\u2019ll tell how she killed their heroic leader before destroying their homes. The tale will grow in the telling, as Shuriman tales are wont to do, until I\u2019ll be known as a heartless murderer, a killer of women and children.<br /><br />The carapace slides back across my face as the first of the monsters scramble onto the ledge. Violet fire sheathes my hands. I feel the familiar rush of excitement as my body fills with heat.<br /><br />If this is what I need to be to keep my people alive, then so be it.<br /><br />That\u2019s a burden I\u2019m willing to bear.<br /><br />I\u2019ll be their monster."]},"table":{"name":"Kai\'Sa","image":"kaisa.png","general":{"Title":"Daughter of the Void","Real Name":"Kaisa","Pronouns":"She/Her","Release date":"March 7th, 2018","Cost":"6300 975","Attribute":"Marksman"},"statistics":{"HP":"600 (+88)","HPR":"3.5 (+0.55)","MP":"344.88 (+38)","MPR":"8.2 (+0.45)","MS":"335","AD":"59 (+2)","AS":"0.644 (+1.8%)","RNG":"525","AR":"28 (+3)","MR":"30 (+0.5)"}},"abilities":[{"key":"Passive","name":"Second Skin","img":"second_skin.png","description":"<span class=\'passiveActive\'>Innate:</span> Kai\'Sa\'s basic attacks deals bonus magic damage.<br /><span style=\'color:purple\'>Caustic Wounds</span><br />Kai\'Sa\'s basic attacks, <span class=\'importantText\'>Void Seeker</span>, and nearby allies\' immobilizing effects mark enemies with <span style=\'color:purple\'>Plasma</span> for 4 seconds, stacking up to 4 times.
